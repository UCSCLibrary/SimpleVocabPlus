Simple Vocab Plus (plugin for Omeka)
====================================

This [Omeka] 2.1+ plugin allows administrators to create, edit, and update 
controlled vocabularies either defined in the repository itself or in the cloud. 

This is an improved fork of the [Simple Vocab Plus] plugin, adding more functions, extending the scope 
and with a user interface optimized too.

New functions: 
- chance to use the values already stored in the repository for the same element as
suggestions;
- chance to check the values stored for a specific element;
- chance to force the use of a list of values (similar to the dropdown feature of the
[Simple Vocab] original plugin.

Scope extended:
- option to enable plugin functionality for Collections too;
- option to enable plugin functionality for Exhibits too (if relative plugin is installed and working).

If you use this plugin, please take a moment to submit feedback about your 
experience, so we can keep making Omeka better: [User Survey].

Configuration

files, collections and exhibits metadata, and to highlight the fields that are using the autosuggest feature.


Warning

It's always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.
