Simple Vocab Plus (plugin for Omeka)
====================================

This [Omeka] 2.1+ plugin allows administrators to create, edit and update 
controlled vocabularies, either defined in the repository itself or in the cloud. 

Version 3.1.2 offers new functions and extends the scope of the original plugin.

New functions: 
- chance to use the values already stored in the repository for the same element as
suggestions;
- chance to use values from multiple fields as suggestions;
- chance to check the values stored for a specific element;
- chance to force the use of a list of values (similar to the dropdown feature of the
[Simple Vocab] original plugin).

Scope extended:
- option to enable plugin functionality for Collections too;
- option to enable plugin functionality for Exhibits too (if relative plugin is installed and working).

If you use this plugin, please take a moment to submit feedback about your experience, so we can keep making Omeka better: [User Survey].


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "SimpleVocabPlus".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.


Configuration
-------------

The brand new configuration panel allows to extend the plugin's functionality to files, collections and exhibits metadata, and to highlight the fields that are using the autosuggest feature.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [plugin issues] page on GitHub.
